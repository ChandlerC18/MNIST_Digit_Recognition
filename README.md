# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
* Classify a handwritten digit!
* Run `build_model.py` to build the machine learning model that is trained and tested using the MNIST dataset
* Run `digit_recognizer.py` to open the app to classify your own handwritten digit
* Based on the project ["Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python"](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-deep-learning-project-handwritten-digit-recognition/) with some adaptions
